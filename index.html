        <b>Getting here:</b><br><br>We recommend flying into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which is about 30 minutes from the city by car. Taxis, rideshares, and rental cars are all convenient options for getting around. You can also take the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.soundtransit.org/ride-with-us/stations/link-light-rail-stations">Link light rail</a> directly from the airport into the city, which costs $3.00 and takes about 40-50 minutes.
        <br><br>
        <b>Where to stay:</b><br><br>We do not have a hotel block reserved, but there are plenty of hotel and Airbnb options in the city to choose from. Some neighborhoods you might want to consider include: Capitol Hill, the University District, and Roosevelt/Ravenna (where we live!), all of which are easily accessible from the light rail.
